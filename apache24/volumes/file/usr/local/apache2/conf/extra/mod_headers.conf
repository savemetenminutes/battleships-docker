# Protect website against clickjacking.
#
# The example below sends the `X-Frame-Options` response header with
# the value `DENY`, informing browsers not to display the content of
# the web page in any frame.
#
# This might not be the best setting for everyone. You should read
# about the other two possible values the `X-Frame-Options` header
# field can have: `SAMEORIGIN` and `ALLOW-FROM`.
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034#section-2.1.
#
# Keep in mind that while you could send the `X-Frame-Options` header
# for all of your website’s pages, this has the potential downside that
# it forbids even non-malicious framing of your content (e.g.: when
# users visit your website using a Google Image Search results page).
#
# Nonetheless, you should ensure that you send the `X-Frame-Options`
# header for all pages that allow a user to make a state changing
# operation (e.g: pages that contain one-click purchase links, checkout
# or bank-transfer confirmation pages, pages that make permanent
# configuration changes, etc.).
#
# Sending the `X-Frame-Options` header can also protect your website
# against more than just clickjacking attacks:

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Force client-side SSL redirection.
#
# If a user types `example.com` in their browser, even if the server
# redirects them to the secure version of the website, that still leaves
# a window of opportunity (the initial HTTP connection) for an attacker
# to downgrade or redirect the request.
#
# The following header ensures that browser will ONLY connect to your
# server via HTTPS, regardless of what the users type in the browser's
# address bar.
#
# (!) Be aware that this, once published, is not revokable and you must ensure
# being able to serve the site via SSL for the duration you've specified
# in max-age. When you don't have a valid SSL connection (anymore) your
# visitors will see a nasty error message even when attempting to connect
# via simple HTTP.
#
# (!) Remove the `includeSubDomains` optional directive if the website's
# subdomains are not using HTTPS.
#
# (1) If you want to submit your site for HSTS preload (2) you must
#     * ensure the `includeSubDomains` directive to be present
#     * the `preload` directive to be specified
#     * the `max-age` to be at least 31536000 seconds (1 year) according to the current status.
#
#     It is also advised (3) to only serve the HSTS header via a secure connection
#     which can be done with either `env=https` or `"expr=%{HTTPS} == 'on'"` (4). The
#     exact way depends on your environment and might just be tried.

# | Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks                       |
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# (1) Try to re-enable the cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built
#     into most web browsers.
#
#     The filter is usually enabled by default, but in some cases it
#     may be disabled by the user. However, in Internet Explorer for
#     example, it can be re-enabled just by sending the
#     `X-XSS-Protection` header with the value of `1`.
#
# (2) Prevent web browsers from rendering the web page if a potential
#     reflected (a.k.a non-persistent) XSS attack is detected by the
#     filter.
#
#     By default, if the filter is enabled and browsers detect a
#     reflected XSS attack, they will attempt to block the attack
#     by making the smallest possible modifications to the returned
#     web page.
#
#     Unfortunately, in some browsers (e.g.: Internet Explorer),
#     this default behavior may allow the XSS filter to be exploited,
#     thereby, it's better to inform browsers to prevent the rendering
#     of the page altogether, instead of attempting to modify it.
#
#     https://hackademix.net/2009/11/21/ies-xss-filter-creates-xss-vulnerabilities
#
# (!) Do not rely on the XSS filter to prevent XSS attacks! Ensure that
#     you are taking all possible measures to prevent XSS attacks, the
#     most obvious being: validating and sanitizing your website's inputs.
